I am a sociologist and demographer who specializes in quantitative methods. Most of my research is focused on issues of racial inequality and categorization. I am particularly interested in integrating insights from the study of racial inequality where racial categories are often treated as static and given, with work on racial boundary formation where the dynamic nature of racial categorization and identification is the object of study. Within this general area of interest, I study many particular topics such as interracial marriage, racial identification, and the life outcomes of mixed race individuals,  across place and time. 

I also have a growing interest in the sociology of religion (and non-religion). I am particularly interested in the relationship between religious identification, beliefs, and practices.
