	abstract = {Skin tone variation within the United States' black population has long been associated with intraracial stratification. Skin tone differentials in socioeconomic status reflect both the inherited privileges ofa mulatto elite and contemporary preferences for lighter skin. Three influential studies have claimed that such differentials in educational,occupational and spousal attainment have remained strong in the post-Civil Rights era,based on results from large nationally representative surveys. However,these studies used a period conception ofchange which ignored the potential for changes across cohorts within the same period.I re-analyze the available data and find significant declines in skin tone differentials for younger cohorts,in terms ofeducational and labor market outcomes,but not in terms ofspousal attainment. These declines begin with cohorts born in the mid-1940s. In addition, there is evidence of period declines of skin tone differentials in occupational attainment in the 1980s.I discuss possible explanations for the declines.},
