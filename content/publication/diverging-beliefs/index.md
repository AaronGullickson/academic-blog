abstract: "Since 1990, the percentage of Americans with no religious afﬁliation has grown substantially. Prior work has shown that between 1990 and 2000, the religiously unafﬁliated population also became more religious in belief and practices, both in absolute terms and relative to the afﬁliated population. This curious empirical ﬁnding is believed to be driven by a dilution effect in which moderate believers disafﬁliated from organized religion without giving up religious beliefs and practices. In the current article, I use data from the General Social Survey to show that this convergence of beliefs and practices of the religiously afﬁliated and unafﬁliated ended around 2000. Since 2000, the religiously unafﬁliated have decreased their belief in God and the afterlife and have not increased their prayer frequency. The trends for the afﬁliated have been either increasing or unchanging, and thus, the religious practices and beliefs of the religiously afﬁliated and unafﬁliated have diverged since 2000. The change in trend for the religiously unafﬁliated after 2000 cannot fully be explained by generational succession or the growing percentage of Americans raised without religion. Although the unafﬁliated remain very heterogeneous in their beliefs and practices, these results point to a growing religious polarization in the United States."
