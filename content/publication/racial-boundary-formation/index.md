abstract: "This article examines variation in the social position of mixed‐race populations by exploiting county‐level variation in the degree of occupational differentiation between blacks and mulattoes in the 1880 U.S. census. The role of the mixed‐race category as either a “buffer class” or a status threat depended on the class composition of whites. Black/mulatto occupational differentiation was greatest where whites had high occupational prestige and thus little to fear from a mulatto group. Furthermore, differentiation increased the risk of lynching where whites had relatively low status and decreased the risk of lynching where whites had relatively high status."
