Over the last few years, I have been building an online textbook on statistical analysis using R. The project began as a series of Canvas pages after I transitioned my undergraduate and graduate statistics courses to R, Over time, it developed into a full-blown textbook that includes reproducible R code, embedded interactive [Shiny Apps](https://shiny.rstudio.com/), embedded videos of slide presentations, and more. 

The textbook is still a work-in-progress, but is usable at this point. It is geared for either a first time undergraduate or graduate course in statistics for sociology students. The design principles behind the book are as follows:

* I assume no prior knowledge of statistics
* I believe that everyone is capable of doing statistics
* My primary focus is on interpretation of statistical results
* Much of the course focuses on model building because this is what we primarily do in the social sciences
* I focus relatively little attention, compared to most introductary statistical textbooks, on statistical inference
* Students work with real and interesting datasets
* Initial datasets are heavily curated so that students can focus on analysis rather than data manipulation
* All material for the textbook is built and deployed using R Markdown

The current version of the textbook is availabe at the link above.
